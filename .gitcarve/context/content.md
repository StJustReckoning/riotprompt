riotprompt helps you capture and create Prompts.

RiotPrompt was designed to help people create prompts that are structured.

To use riotprompt you create Sections that contant Instructions, Context, and Content to create a Prompt that is structured.

riotprompt has a Parser that can read sections of Instructions that are stored in Markdown, and it also has a Formatter that is used to generate content in either Markdown or in a format that uses tags that resemble something like XML.

riotprompt is written in Typescript and uses Jest for testing and Vite and SWC to build the library.  riotprompt uses the "marked" library to parse Markdown.

riotprompt has a GitHub repository here https://github.com/riotprompt
